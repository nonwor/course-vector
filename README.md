# Course-Vector
This project utilizes word embeddings to discover courses relevant to job titles or areas of interest. Word embeddings offer flexible context-based searching, eliminating the need for lexicons or word matching. The front-end UI is created with React. The model is served by FastAPI and deployed on Heroku via docker container. Please see FastAPI repo for deployment steps and requirements. Note: Trained model and pickle file exceed the GitHub file size limit. Please reach out for those files if you wish to run them locally.
The project and model are deployed on the web, using local storage to save data for the user. The project can be run on your local machine, you will need to change the Axios fetch call to the local server.

## Example of Project Running
![alt text](homepage.png)
![alt text](savepage.png)


This project was bootystrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
